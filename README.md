This is a file to run an experiment.
We will create training data.

X=stochastic valuation parameters 
Y=option value computed by the stochastic valuation model

We will then train a ML model that tries to predict the results of the stochastic valuation model.

We will then compare the time it takes to run the two models.
A forward pass on the trained ML model vs. Stochastic model with enough runs to converge to value

We will also look at the accuracy of the trained ML model to the stochastic valuation model.
